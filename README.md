## Xyntia Artifacts

This archive contains major datasets used to evaluate Xyntia:
* b1 is the dataset from Blazytko et al. to evaluate Syntia; 
* b2 is our custom dataset used to extend the evaluation of Syntia and compare it to our new AI-based blackbox deobfuscator Xyntia;
* bp1, bp2 and bp3 and the three datasets used to evaluate Xyntia over complex handlers (see section 8.2);
* merged1, merged2, merged3, merged4, merged5 are the datasets used in section 8.3 to evalaute Xyntia against merged handlers (see Section 8.3). 


A virtual machine (~2.3G) is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lDL85jtSoLkCkI4rDx1wjEgE6df0SHCx/view?usp=sharing (md5: 7fbbfa380e48d558c7797c5792d63811 ; sha256 : 0ce85bb35b4ce13b58aae8c970f3d59012f75207e7cc284a806d2e45f660c25f). It contains all these datasets, the Xyntia binary and scripts to exercise Xyntia and replay major experiments. The user password is "user" (and the root password is "root").
